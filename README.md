👋 Hi, I’m Chandresh Lakhara
I'm an enthusiastic and motivated aspiring software developer and graphic designer, passionate about building meaningful technology and creative digital experiences. I constantly push my limits through learning, designing, and collaborating with like-minded people.

🚀 What I’m Currently Working On
📘 Deepening my understanding of .NET — from core concepts to building real-world backend solutions
🐍 Exploring Python for scripting, automation, and potentially diving into data analysis
🌐 Learning the fundamentals of web development — including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — to create full-stack applications in the near future

🎨 Creative Side — Graphic Design
Alongside coding, I have a strong passion for graphic design. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly designs that complement functionality — whether it’s UI/UX, branding, or digital content.
This blend of design + development helps me think holistically when building digital products.

🤝 What I’m Looking For
I’m actively seeking opportunities to:

Collaborate on open-source or personal projects

Team up with developers and designers to learn, build, and grow together

Contribute to projects where I can make a real impact, both visually and functionally

🧠 What Drives Me
I believe in the power of consistency, curiosity, and community. I’m not just learning to code — I’m learning to think like a developer and a designer, solve problems creatively, and evolve with every new challenge.

📫 Let’s Connect!
Always happy to connect with fellow learners, mentors, or creative minds.
