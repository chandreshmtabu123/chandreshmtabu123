🚀 What I’m Currently Working On
📘 Deepening my understanding of .NET — from core concepts to building real-world backend solutions

🐍 Exploring Python for scripting, automation, and potentially diving into data analysis

🌐 Learning the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create full-stack applications in the near future

Join forces with developers to learn, build, and grow together

Contribute to codebases where I can make a meaningful impact while gaining practical experience

🧠 What Drives Me
I believe in the power of consistency, curiosity, and community. I’m not just learning to code — I’m learning to think like a developer, solve problems creatively, and grow with every challenge I take on.
